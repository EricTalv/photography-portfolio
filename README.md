Build a static photography portfolio 

## Project Status

I got the project to a point of near completion, though
near the end of the project I decided that a custom static site 
for a photography portfolio was somewhat unnecessary, since
such a website would be occasionally updated and a static site 
without a headless CMS is very cumbersome to update.

I still decided to work on the site, for my own curiosity.

The newer site I designed and made in wordpress and 
can be seen [here](https://luella.photography)
